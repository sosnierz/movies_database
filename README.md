# movies_database




In this project you can create your own lists with films, which you would like to watch or have already watched.
There you can find information about each movie:
- title
- short description
- year of production
- ranking

## Motivation
I really wanted to create something using JavaScript library - React. It is currently the most commonly used front-end development technology in the world, that's why I had decided to use it in my project. Additionally I used free online database.

## Tech

In this project I used:

- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Hooks - Reducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/)
